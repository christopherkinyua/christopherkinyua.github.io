							<h2>About Circuits 2.</h2>
						</header>
						<p> This course was a continuation of circuits 1 that we learnt in first year. It introduced new 
							concepts and modifications of what we had learnt in circuit 1. This involved looking at 
							op-amps and the various types of op-amps. We also covered the circuit responses of various 
							circuit orientations like RC circuits using techniques such as Laplace and the Two Port Network. 
							We also went over filters and their applications.

                        <p>
                            The labs that we did proved to be useful when it came to the development of our School Project. 
							We learnt the use of the filters and this aided in the audio component of our project.
							We had a lab that taught us how to make a filter and also have an audio gain for the speaker 
							that we had. This was useful as we could allow the user to change the volume of the alarm.
                        </p>
						<p>
							The information we learnt here also proved to be useful in our research project for one of our 
							class, ENEL 327, which is about signals and transforms. As a group we decided to research about 
							filters and the information we gained from this course gave us a good foundation.

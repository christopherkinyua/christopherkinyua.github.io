							During this class we learned about software development and project management.
							We incorporated the Agile process of program management which I have found to be very useful. 
							It allows a lot of room for change and modification compared to more rigid and robust methods 
							like the waterfall method which is hard to incorporate new ideas once the design process has 
							already started. We are also able to preform multiple revisions to make the project better.
						</p>
						<p>
							We used the SCRUM framework where we split the project into various sections with certain deliverables 
							called sprints. This format gave us a lot of flexibility when it came to working through our project. 
							Due to the current way things are due to COVID, this really helped us as we came across some unavoidable 
							obstacles which we were able to get around due to its flexibility.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the many things that I took away from all of this was communication. It was very important to communicate 
							amongst ourselves so we could achieve the set deadlines. We hosted daily meetings where we would discuss what we 
							have done, what obstacle we have reached and how to move forward.

						<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>

                        <p>
							This course has given me an opportunity to listen to a lot of creative minds of the students 
							in the electrical engineering faculty. I have heard lots of crazy ideas and some ideas that 
							tackle crucial matters affecting various parts of the society. This has helped improve my view 
							on things as a future entrepreneur.
                        </p>
						<p>
							Throughout this course, we have been drilled into us skills to make us entrepreneurs. Some of the 
							exercises we constantly carried out are:
							<ul>
								<li>Making User Stories</li>
								<li>Making pitches</li>
								<li>Making a business plan</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							By creating user stories, I am able to view our product from the users perspective and see if it 
							is a viable product and how it plays a part in their day to day lives. With a user story, it helps 
							guide the produc development and have a target audience for it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The pitches have helped build confidence and brush up our presentation skills. It has helped me improve 
							my delivery of ideas that I have and to push forward our product to our users and sponsors.

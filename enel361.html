							<h2>About Electronic Devices and Materials.</h2>
						</header>
						<p> This course was very interesting as we learnt the workings of most of the devices that we 
							learnt in our first year of engineering. This includes devices such as op-amps, transistors, 
							diodes and many more. We looked at the practical appliance of such devices in our day-to-day 
							lives like in our mobile phones and laptops and got some hands-on experience with the Labs
                            we did through out the course. We also covered how charge carriers move within semiconductors 
							showing use how the chips within our devices operate.
						</p>
                        <p>
                            The labs proved to be extremely useful when it came to the development of our School Project. 
							We learnt the use of the thermistor and we had an entire lab dedicated to it.
                            This was the fundamental basis of our project and it proved to be key when it came to it 
							development. We incoporated the design from the lab and modified it as per what we needed 
                            for our project. I also learnt bench marking skills when it came to observing values from a 
							voltmeter and oscilloscope and comparing them with the theoretical value that we calculated.

                            Looking back on this I can confirm I was able to maintain a civil relationship 
                            with my group members in my ILS. In the end I managed to build actual friendships where 
							we are open to each other and even tease each other and make lots of jokes. This was an 
							actual goal of mine as due to covid, I was unable to build an actual connection with my fellow 
							classmates. In terms of my contributions, I become one of the major contributors in my learning 
							community. This was a positive for me as I always thought that I come off as slow. Through my contributions 
							and stating ontop of my classes, I should be able to have raised my grade as I had greater understanding of 
							the content and through peer learning. Finally, I am proud that I stuck to my promise of taking photos as 
                            I went out and took a bunch of photos compared to my last semester where I hardly carried out 
                            my hobby.

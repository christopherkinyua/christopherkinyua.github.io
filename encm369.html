							<h2>About Computer Organisation</h2>
						</header>
						<p> This course bridged the gap between the coding aspect and the hardware aspect of Electrical
                            Engineering. It taught use the fundamentals behind the architecture of computers and how they are
                             able to multi-task and do the functions that we take for granted. Essentially, we could build a low
                              end computer using this information. This was very interesting to me as I've been able to build a personal 
                              computer but it was like playing with LEGO as I was just putting in the physical components together without any
                               thought of how they worked.

                            Through out the course we used pic micro-controllers to perform various tasks. One of the Labs included using the micro-controller 
                            to make LEDS blink using a pattern we defined by ourselves. That was my favourite lab as I was able to implement a wide variety of patterns
                            .Using the information I gained from the labs, we were able to incorporate this into out final project as we coded the pic to be able to read the values of 
                            the thermistor and convert the voltage reading into temperature values of the room so we could monitor the temperature.

							The one thing I can take way from this class is the programming of a PIC micro-controller. It was 
							very fundamental for use to learnt to do so for our project and helped me understand low-level coding 
							in a more practical sense.

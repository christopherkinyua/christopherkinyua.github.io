							<h2>Internship Experience</h2>
						</header>
						<p> During the summer when I was back in my home-country, Kenya, I was graced with the chance to work in an Electric Engineering Company called Imex Solutions.
							They specialise in the power and automations sector and offer full project solutions from design, manufacture through to the final installation and commission.
							Imexolutions has a wide range of collaborators with whom they work with to deliver the best services to their clients. Their biggest partner is Schneider Electric,
							who are their main suppliers of the high-end quality equipment which is used in the implementation of their electrical solutions. Schneider Electric provide a wide 
							range of products like; Contactors, Overloads, Motor Protection Relays, Variable Speed Drives, Miniature Circuit Breakers, Power Distributions and Modules and many more
						</p>
                        <p>
                            With this kind of standing of a company, I was extremely grateful for the opportunity. I was placed under the Trainees and I worked under the more experienced people in the industry.
							They showed me the ropes and taught me a lot about the power industry abd their principles. Considering I was a firstyear at the time, I felt challenged as I lacked the basic information about most components and how they worked 
							compared to my third-year peers that were with me as trainees. I took it upon myself to do lots of research and the entire work force was friendly as to go over most of the fundamental things i would know so I could carry out my day-to-day tasks in the company.
							I also asked to be moved around various departments of the company such as the: Panels Set-up, Bus bar and the Controls departments so I could get as much hands-on experience and make the most out of the opportunity I had.

                        </p>
						<p>
							This taught me a lot of lessons that I have been able to incoporate into my school experience. It taught me the importance of teamwork for we are as strong as our weakest link. Due to my lack of knowledge, I would tend to hold back the project but through the aid of my seniors we were able to make due and 
							finish the projects on time. I also learnt about project development as I saw the entire process from the stage of conception to the actual design and making of the project before it is shipped to the clients.
							I also learnt basic circuits which helped with the breadboard management and wiring making it visually appleasing!
